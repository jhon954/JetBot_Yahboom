# Project with ROS2 Humble: Recreation of Yahboom AI Robot for NVIDIA Jetson Nano B01 A02

## Project Description
This repository contains a ROS2 Humble recreation of the Yahboom AI Robot for NVIDIA Jetson Nano B01 A02. It includes mesh models, URDF for physics simulation, Gazebo simulation files, computer vision algorithms for ball or circular object tracking, Gazebo worlds for testing, and RViz for model and mesh visualization.

## System Requirements
To run this project, the following is required:
- ROS2 Humble installed on the system.
- Gazebo for robot simulation.
- RViz for model and mesh visualization.
- Additional dependencies specified in configuration files.

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Install dependencies specified in configuration files.
3. Use ROS2 commands to execute different components of the project, such as Gazebo simulation or RViz visualization.
4. Explore configuration files and computer vision algorithms to customize robot behavior according to your needs.
